\subsection{Aim of the project}
The idea is to find a cost-performance ratio comparing methods (and hopefully in
hardware) like \textit{YOLO}, \textit{SSD}, \textit{R-CNN} and
\textit{Fast R-CNN} for object detection, this focused mainly on autonomous
driving, and thus find a way to implement autonomous driving at lower costs
without losing much accuracy.

\subsection{Object Detection for Autonomous Driving}
Is Autonomous driving only a \textit{"Sci-fi dream"}? Or can we make it real?


Well, there have been a lot of projects and researchs to make this possible, and
little by little we are getting cloese to it. But why bother to do autonomous
driving? Is there any benefit? We have some benefits like \textbf{safety}, 
\textbf{mobility}, \textbf{environmental}, \textbf{efficiency}, even 
\textbf{economic} ones, a NHTSA
(\textit{National Highway Traffic Safety Administration}) study showed that
motor vehicle crashes cost billions each year. Eliminating the majority of
vehicle crashes through technology could reduce this cost \cite{nhtsa}.\\


The future is a \textbf{Road to Full Automation}. Cars and trucks that drive us,
instead of us driving them may offer transformative safety opportunities at
their maturity. At this time, even the highest level of driving automation
available to consumers requires the full engagement and undivided attention of
drivers. There is considerable investment into safe testing, development and
validation of automated driving systems. These automotive technology
advancements also have the potential to improve equity, air pollution,
accessibility and traffic congestion.
